<p><em>RunGunJumpGun</em> is a tough as nails video game that puts a teeth-rattling, gravity-defying weapon in your hands. With a cast of crazed characters, simple but stupid-hard gameplay, and pulsing musical score, RunGunJumpGun is a loud, trippy mess of twitchy platforming goodness. </p>

<p>Fusing traditional platforming and junky web-browser style helicopter games, RunGunJumpGun revolves around one very big, very loud gun. Aim it forward to clear a path, destroying whatever gets in your way. Blast that thing at the ground, and the force will propel you into the air &mdash; letting you helicopter through snaking hallways of spikes, turrets, and saws. Two-button&rsquo;s worth of terror.</p>
 
<p>RunGunJumpGun features warped psychedelic visuals and sweltering beats designed to drive you through this hyperkinetic world. Our tight-knit team scored, illustrated, animated and wrote RunGunJumpGun all working together in one room. One tiny, smelly room.</p>
